    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 16 oz can low-fat refried beans (you may not need the entire can)< /li>
        <li>2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
        <li>1/2 cup salsa< /li>
        <li>vegetable oil or cooking spray</li>
        <li>8 flour tortillas fajita or taco size</li>
        <li>1 10 oz can red enchilada sauce (you will only need about half a can)< /li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Mexican blend cheese</li>
        <li>2 green onions thinly sliced</li>
        <p>2 Roma tomatoes diced</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350ÂºF.</li>
        <li>Warm up beans in a small bowl in the microwave. Combine chicken and salsa in another bowl and warm it up in
            the microwave.</li>
        <li>To toast the tortillas, either heat oil in a skillet and fry both sides of the tortilla, or spray both sides
            of tortilla with cooking spray and heat on skillet (my preferred method).</li>
        <li>Lay four of the toasted tortillas on a large baking sheet. Spread with about 2 tablespoons of refried beans
            on each tortilla. Top with the salsa/chicken mixture, evenly dividing it among the four tortillas. Top with
            another toasted tortilla.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of enchilada sauce on the top of each tortilla. Sprinkle with shredded cheese, evenly
            dividing it among the four pizzas. Bake in preheated oven for 5-7 minutes, or until the cheese is melted.<
                /li>
        <li>Cut into triangles and serve immediately. Enjoy!< /li>
