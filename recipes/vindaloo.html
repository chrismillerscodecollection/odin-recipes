    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">
        Chicken Vindaloo is a bold and flavorful Indian curry dish known for its fiery spice and tangy undertones.
        Originally inspired by the Portuguese dish “carne de vinha d’alhos” (meat marinated in wine and garlic), it was
        adapted in the Indian state of Goa with the addition of local spices and vinegar, creating a unique fusion of
        East and West.

        This dish typically features tender pieces of chicken marinated in a mixture of vinegar, garlic, ginger, and a
        blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, paprika, cinnamon, and chili powder. Once marinated, the chicken is
        slow-cooked with onions, tomatoes, and sometimes potatoes, producing a thick, aromatic sauce that is rich in
        depth and complexity.

        Chicken Vindaloo is beloved for its perfect balance of heat, acidity, and subtle sweetness. It is usually served
        with basmati rice or naan, making it a satisfying and robust meal for those who enjoy spicy cuisine with a touch
        of history.
