    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">
        Chicken Vindaloo is a bold and flavorful Indian curry dish known for its fiery spice and tangy undertones.
        Originally inspired by the Portuguese dish “carne de vinha d’alhos” (meat marinated in wine and garlic), it was
        adapted in the Indian state of Goa with the addition of local spices and vinegar, creating a unique fusion of
        East and West.

        This dish typically features tender pieces of chicken marinated in a mixture of vinegar, garlic, ginger, and a
        blend of spices such as cumin, coriander, paprika, cinnamon, and chili powder. Once marinated, the chicken is
        slow-cooked with onions, tomatoes, and sometimes potatoes, producing a thick, aromatic sauce that is rich in
        depth and complexity.

        Chicken Vindaloo is beloved for its perfect balance of heat, acidity, and subtle sweetness. It is usually served
        with basmati rice or naan, making it a satisfying and robust meal for those who enjoy spicy cuisine with a touch
        of history.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ to 3 lb/1.2 to 1.4 kg skinless bone-in chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>15 whole Kashmiri chillies</li>
        <li>12 whole cloves</li>
        <li>10 to 12 garlic cloves/total weight about 30 to 35 g</li>
        <li>2 in/5 cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 in/2.5 cm cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 tsp whole black peppercorns</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>¾ cup/180 ml malt or apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup/120 ml water</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp/45 ml neutral oil, such as grapeseed</li>
        <li>2 large red onions/total weight about 800 g, diced</li>
        <li>Fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat the chicken dry and transfer to a large mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Grind the Kashmiri chillies, cloves, garlic, ginger, cinnamon, peppercorns, cumin, vinegar, and water
            together in a high-speed blender to get a smooth paste. Add the spice paste to the chicken with 1 tsp of
            salt. Fold to coat well and leave covered for 30 minutes at room temperature.</li>
        <li>While the chicken marinates in the vinegar spice mixture, cook the onions. Heat the oil over medium-high
            heat in a medium Dutch oven or non-reactive thick heavy-bottomed stainless-steel saucepan. Add the onions
            with a tiny pinch of salt and sauté until they turn light brown. The cooking time will vary. If the onions
            start to burn, add a tablespoon or two of water. Fold in the marinated chicken with the marinade. Stir in
            the turmeric and sugar. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover with a lid, and occasionally stir to prevent the
            chicken from sticking to the bottom of the pot and burning. Cook until the chicken turns tender, opaque, and
            thoroughly cooked. If the liquid levels drop during cooking, add a few tablespoons of water/li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove from the heat. The vindaloo can be eaten immediately, but I prefer to let it sit in the
            refrigerator for a day to improve the flavors. The chicken vindaloo can be stored in the refrigerator in an
            airtight container for up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
